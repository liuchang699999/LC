    "This tour explores the formulation of 3D beam-like elastic structures in FEniCS. One particularity of this tour is that the mesh topology is 1D (beams) but is embedded in a 3D ambient space. We will also show how to define a local frame containing the beam axis direction and two perpendicular directions for the definition of the cross-section geometrical properties. This tour is illustrated on a shell-like structure made of beams and is available in `.xdmf` format."

    "## Variational formulation: beam kinematics and consititutive equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational formulation for 3D beams requires to distinguish between motion along the beam direction and along both perpendicular directions. These two directions often correspond to principal directions of inertia and distinguish between stong and weak bending directions. The user must therefore specify this local orientation frame throughout the whole structure. In this example, we will first compute the vector $t$ tangent to the beam direction, and two perpendicular directions $a_1$ and $a_2$. $a_1$ will always be perpendicular to $t$ and the vertical direction, while $a_2$ will be such that $(t, a_1, a_2)$ is a direct orthonormal frame.\n",
    "\n",
    " In the following, we will consider a Timoshenko beam model with St-Venant uniform torsion theory for the torsional part. The beam kinematics will then be described by a 3D displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and an independent 3D rotation field $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, that is 6 degrees of freedom at each point. $(u_t,u_1,u_2)$ will respectively denote the displacement components in the section local frame $(t, a_1, a_2)$. Similarly, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ will denote the section rotations about the two section axis whereas $\\theta_t$ is the twist angle.\n",
